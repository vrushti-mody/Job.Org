## About The Project

Due to Covid-19 many have lost their jobs, the only source of their income. 

I want to help those people find jobs as soon as possible. Many websites such as LinkedIn, Naukri, indeed, and other reputed sites are too difficult to navigate or their primary focus group is people with degrees. 

The sites are not meant for blue collar workers by the virtue of design. Also the language barrier does not help. 

I would like to give my time to build a website that will help people find jobs, and find a way to life with dignity. The website will be launched with basic features and it will be developed in an open source manner. 


### Features

#### 1. Helps Workers Find Jobs

Amidst the COVID-19 Pandemic, this will be an effective way to help workers find jobs.

#### 2. Benefits to the Employer

Our platform lets users post jobs for free. Rather than calling up thousands of people to get house help or for anything else, you can easily get people who are willing to work on this application

#### 3. Language Translation

The application can be translated to the users native language for better user experience.
